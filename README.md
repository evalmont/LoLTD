League of Legends: Tower Defense


- Goal

The goal of this project to get experience developing a simple video game.  This is a non-profit project and is primarily for learning purposes.

- Inspiration

As an avid League of Legends player I've decided to take it's theme and apply it to another style game.

*As this is an initial commit this README is very underwhelming.  It will be updated on a future commit.
